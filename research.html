                    Irrational Managers, Crises and Rational Expectations Equilibrium
                </a>
            </p>
            <p class="abstract">
                <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper develops a rational expectations framework to explain how financial crises can emerge endogenously in an economy where some decision-makers are irrational. We model an economy with a continuum of managers who choose whether to invest in a risky project with negative expected net present value. Rational managers invest only upon receiving a positive signal about project quality, while irrational managers always invest. Managers cannot distinguish whether others’ investments stem from private information or irrationality, creating a signal-confounding problem. This may lead uninformed rational managers to herd and invest based on observed behavior, even in the absence of informative signals. The paper characterizes equilibrium conditions under which such behavior leads to over-investment and financial crises. Our model highlights how crises can arise not from external shocks or irrational beliefs per se, but from rational responses to the behavior of a minority of irrational actors. This provides new insights into the endogenous origins of crises and the role of social learning in amplifying risk.

                    Climate Change in the C-Suite: CEO Origins and Green Decisions
                </a>
            </p>
            <p class="abstract">
                <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper explores how CEO origin—whether internal or external to the firm—affects corporate environmental performance, particularly following CEO turnover events. We ask whether external CEOs are less committed to environmental goals than their internal counterparts or predecessors, and whether this divergence reflects differences in beliefs, incentives, or disruption to corporate culture. Drawing on the growing literature on corporate culture as a determinant of firm behavior (Gorton, 2022), we hypothesize that internal successors—having been socialized into the firm's existing values—are more likely to uphold implicit environmental norms. In contrast, external CEOs, unconstrained by such norms and potentially holding different beliefs or facing short-term performance pressures, may view environmental commitments as non-binding and opt to cut "green" investments as a cost-saving strategy. This mechanism is particularly salient for struggling firms, where cost pressures intensify, but may also hold for non-distressed firms where new leadership seeks to quickly demonstrate performance gains. Using a panel of firm-level emissions data and CEO turnover information, we empirically test whether firms that appoint external CEOs exhibit a statistically significant increase in emissions relative to those with internal CEO succession or no change in leadership. Our findings contribute to the literature on leadership, corporate culture, and environmental responsibility by uncovering a potential trade-off between CEO mobility and sustainability performance. The results also raise important questions about the role of non-contractible cultural elements in shaping corporate environmental behavior.
